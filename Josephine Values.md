# Josephine Core Values

At Josephine, our Values are used for navigation. If our [Mission](josephine.com/mission) describes our desired destination, our Values are the compass with which we stay on track. We've written our values as mantras - exactly the way they are said and used by our team to make decisions.

##Be More Human

Our work is to practice **empathy**. This means putting ourselves in other peoples’ shoes even when (especially when) it’s difficult, inconvenient, and when others around us aren’t. We are a diverse team with varied perspectives and talents, but empathetic development is an explicit goal for our entire team. This is our advantage, our pride, and the differentiating factor behind how we are building Josephine.

##Give Boldly, Give First

We **trust** in the power of giving. Our world’s systemic inequality means that people need different amounts of support to achieve the same outcomes. We acknowledge our privilege by making the first investment in the trust of our cooks, our team, and our partners. Giving boldly and giving first is how we fight for true equity.

##Teach 'em How to Fish

We create impact through **empowerment**. The opportunity for pride and creative agency is crucial for improving peoples’ livelihoods. Josephine’s impact on it’s community can only be sustainable and scalable if we respect the individuality of our cooks, our team, and our community.
