# Welcome to Josephine

Hey! Welcome to the Josephine team, we’re so excited to have you with us. We’re hoping you’re going to learn a lot working here and that we’ll learn a lot from you. But first, this document will help you start figuring out how Josephine works and how we work together.

At Josephine, we’re trying to build a mission and values-driven organization, so you’ll find that a lot of our policies differ from the norm at other companies. If you have any questions about why we do things a certain way, or have a suggestion about how we can do anything better, please let us know (or just write comments in the documents -- you should already have comment access to everything in the Josephine handbook!).

## Your First Day

Your first day is a chance to get introduced to everyone you're working with and start setting things up the way you like them. First days are hard and mostly we want you to be getting comfortable today.

Please arrive around 10a and expect the day to look something like this: 

* 10-11a— Arrive and get settled 
* 11-11:45a— State of Josephine business update 
* Noon-12:45p— Lunch with your team
* 1-1:30p— Cook Ops, Biz Ops or Product Team introduction
* 1:30-2p— Cook Ops, Biz Ops or Product Team introduction
* 2:30-4:30p— Kickoff with your team 
* 6-7p— Optional social activity (dinner, dessert or drink) with entire team

If you have any food preferences or restrictions that we should consider, let us know!


## The End of Your First Day

At the end of your first day, you can choose how you want to celebrate with your new team. You have three options:

* We can all do a group high five and cheer for you

* We can go out for a drink or dessert nearby together

* We can all go to dinner somewhere nearby

The first day can be intense, so if you’re feeling drained we can all cheer together and send you home to get ready for day number two. If you’re feeling energized and pumped to be with the team, you can choose one of the more involved options. We just want to celebrate with you however you feel comfortable!

## The Basics about Josephine

**Josephine is a values-driven company.** Hopefully you heard about this a lot during your interview process, but we take our values really seriously at Josephine and they guide the decisions we make here. You can read more about the [Josephine Values](https://github.com/josephine/handbook/blob/master/Josephine%20Values.md), but the short versions are:

* Be More Human

* Give Boldly, Give First

* Teach 'em How to Fish

**Our mission is hugely ambitious.** We want to build the identity standard for the Internet. This is a massive undertaking, and we have to be a little bit delusional to believe that we can do it. But every day we’re making progress and we’ve already taken this a lot further than anyone said was possible, so we’re used to making the impossible happen. This is hard, daunting work, but that’s how we make a dent on the world.

## The Josephine Team, Hours, and Office

For now, Josephine operates as a single team where everyone is working towards company-level goals. Since we’re still small, there’s not too much overhead in keeping up with everyone. There are still engineering-specific meetings, and marketing conversations that happen separately. But when we set our goals, we all think directly about how we contribute to the company goals. You’ll get to work with everyone at Josephine in some capacity, and dip your fingers into all different kinds of thinking.

We believe that if you have too much on your plate, then you can only see what’s right in front of you. You need space and time to think about the future and plan ahead. If we give ourselves room to breathe and think and live, we’re capable of much broader thinking. To achieve that, we try to create a culture that’s not based on scarcity.

You should expect a typical workweek at Josephine to be 45-50 hours. Most people show up between 9 and 10 and leave between 6 and 7. We don’t work weekends, but a lot of us host or go to events at night. This is to give you a sense of what’s normal here, but you should work the hours that are healthy and sustainable for you.

We try to make the office atmosphere welcoming and respectful for people of all different backgrounds. This is an ongoing process of negotiating and compromising as we share space, and depends on good communication. If there are specific things you like or want to change, let us know. We’re always getting better :)

## The Future

Josephine is a small company that is changing and improving rapidly. Today is about welcoming you and helping you join our team, but soon we’ll need your help growing and learning. Josephine will be a very different company a year from today, and it’s hard to imagine what it will be like in 5 or 10. You will have a hand in building that company, and we’re so excited to have your help.
