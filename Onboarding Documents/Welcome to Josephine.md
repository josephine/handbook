# Welcome to Josephine

Hey! Welcome to the Josephine team, we’re so excited to have you with us. We’re hoping you’re going to learn a lot working here and that we’ll learn a lot from you. But first, this document will help you start figuring out how Josephine works and how we work together.

At Josephine, we’re trying to build a mission and values-driven organization, so you’ll find that a lot of our policies differ from the norm at other companies. If you have any questions about why we do things a certain way, or have a suggestion about how we can do anything better, please let us know (or just write comments in the documents -- you should already have comment access to everything in the Josephine handbook!).

## Arrival Logistics

Your first day is a chance to get introduced to everyone you're working with and start setting things up the way you like them. First days are hard and mostly we want you to be getting comfortable today.

Please arrive by 10a to our office in Oakstop: 1721 Broadway #202, Oakland, CA 94612 

You should bring your computer and charger, or have let us know that you intend to use a Josephine computer setup. 

## Your First Day Schedule

* 11-11:45a— State of Josephine business update

## The End of Your First Day

At the end of your first day, you can choose how you want to celebrate with your new team. You have three options:

* We can all do a group high five and cheer for you

* We can go out for a drink or dessert nearby together

* We can all go to dinner somewhere nearby

The first day can be intense, so if you’re feeling drained we can all cheer together and send you home to get ready for day number two. If you’re feeling energized and pumped to be with the team, you can choose one of the more involved options. We just want to celebrate with you however you feel comfortable!

## The Josephine Team and Office

You'll get a sense for our team culture and workstyle organically, but on your first day we'll make an effort to at least preview each team's focus and current projects. Although we have three teams within Josephine (Cook Ops, Biz Ops, and Product), we are small enough that most major projects still touch every team. When we set our individual goals, we all think directly about how they contribute to the overall company goals. You’ll get to work with everyone at Josephine in some capacity, and dip your fingers into all different kinds of thinking.

We try to make the office atmosphere welcoming and respectful for people of all different backgrounds. This is an ongoing process of negotiating and compromising as we share space, and depends on good communication. If there are specific things you like or want to change, let us know!
